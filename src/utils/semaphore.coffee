# This class can be used to wait for tasks to finish before firing a series of
# callbacks. Once start() is called, the callbacks fire as soon as the count
# reaches 0. Thus, you should increment the count before starting it. When
# adding a callback after having fired causes the callback to be called right
# away. Incrementing the count after it fired results in an error.
#
# @example
#
#   semaphore = new Semaphore()
#
#   semaphore.increment()
#   doSomething().then(semaphore.decrement())
#
#   doAnotherThingThatTakesACallback(semaphore.wait())
#
#   semaphore.start()
#
#   semaphore.addCallback(-> print('hello'))
#
#   # Once count reaches 0 callback is executed:
#   # => 'hello'
#
#   # Assuming that semaphore was already fired:
#   semaphore.addCallback(-> print('this will print immediately'))
#   # => 'this will print immediately'
